# dreact

Build web applications as easy as datarockets do ðŸš€

It's based on nextjs, so all `next/*` imports work directy

## To Do

- [ ] Add .next to gitignore and probably rename
- [ ] Turn off telemetry for projects
- [ ] Setup .npmignore for each package
- [ ] Using webpack 5. Reason: no next.config.js

## CLI

- [x] `dreact app dev`
- [x] `dreact app build`
- [x] `dreact app export`
- [x] `dreact app start`

- [ ] `dreact spa dev`
- [ ] `dreact spa build`
